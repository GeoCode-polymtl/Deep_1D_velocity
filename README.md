# 1D Velocity estimation using neural-networks

Code for reproducing results in ["Seismic velocity estimation: a deep recurrent neural-network approach"](tobeannounced)


## Installation

You should clone this repository

    git clone https://github.com/gfabieno/SeisCL.git

#### a) Use Docker (easiest)

We provide a Docker image that contains all necessary python libraries like Tensorflow
and the seismic modeling code SeisCL.

You first need to install the Docker Engine, following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
To use GPUs, you also need to install the [Nvidia docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker).
For the later to work, Nvidia drivers should be installed.
Then, when in the project repository, build the docker image as follows:

    docker build -t seisai:v0

You can then launch any of the python scripts in this repo as follows:

    docker run --gpus all -it\
               -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` \
               --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
               seisai:v0 Case_article.py --logdir=./Case_article

This makes accessible all gpus (`--gpus all`), mounting the current directory to a
to the same path in the docker (second line), running the docker as the current user
(for file permission), and runs the script `Case_article.py`.

#### b) Install all requirements

It is recommended to create a new virtual environment for this project with Python3.
The main python requirements are:
*   [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org). This project was tested with versions 1.8 to 1.15.
The preferred method of installation is through pip, but many options are available. If using pip, be sure to use python version of <=3.7, as tensorflow 1 is not available from 3.8. 
*  [SeisCL](https://github.com/gfabieno/SeisCL). Follow the instruction in the README of
the SeisCL repository. Preferred compiling options for this project are api=opencl (use
OpenCL, which is faster than CUDA for small models) and nompi=1, because no MPI parallelization is required.
Be sure to install SeisCL's python wrapper.

Once SeisCL is installed, you can install all other python requirements with

    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Reproducing the results

Figures of the article can be reproduced with the script  `reproduce_results.py`.
This script automates the following steps.

#### 1. Training set creation

To create the synthetic training set, do:

    python Case_article.py --training=0
    
Note that to speed up data creation, several GPUs can be used as follows:
    
    export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0; python Case_article.py --training=0
    export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1; python Case_article.py --training=0

The same strategy can be applied for the subsequent steps.

#### 2. Testing set creation (1D)

To create the synthetic 1D training set, do:

    python Case_article_test1D.py --testing=0

#### 3. Training

Perform the training  with the following command:

    python Case_article.py --training=1 --logdir=Case_article
    
This will train 16 models, for which logs and results will be stored in `Case_article0`,
`Case_article1` and so on.

#### 4. Plot training loss (Figure 2)

To reproduce Figure 2 for trained model 0:

    python plot_loss.py --logdir=Case_article0 --dataset_path=dataset_article/test/dhmin5layer_num_min10

#### 5. Testing in 1D (Figure 3)

Perform the testing on the 1D test set with

    python Case_article_test1D.py --testing=1 --logdir=Case_article*/4_* --niter=1000

This will test on all the trained models contained in `Case_articleX`, for models at iteration
1000 for the 4th step of the training. The predictions for each model are stored in
`/dataset_article/test/Case_articleX`. Figure 3 is reproduced along the test statistics.

#### 6. Testing in 2D (Figure 4)

To create the 2D test set and perform the testing:

    python Case_article_test2D.py --testing=1 --logdir=Case_article*/4_* --niter=1000

This will create the 2D testing set (may take a while) and test on all the trained models.
Figure 4 is produced along the test statistics.

#### 7. Testing on real data (Figures 5 and 6)

To download and preprocess the real data set:

    cd realdata
    python Process_realdata.py

Then the testing is carried with

    python Case_article_testreal.py --plots=2 --logdir=Case_article*/4_* --niter=1000

This produces Figures 5 and 6.
